<h1> Ағылшын тіліндегі Ыбырай Алтынсарин
өмірбаяны. Biography of  Ybyrai Altynsarin </h1>
  
 <p>
    Ibrai Altynsarin went down in the history of Kazakhstan as an outstanding educator, teacher, poet, public figure.<br><br>
Ibrai Altynsarin was born on October 20, 1841 in the Arkaragay volost (now Zatobolsk district) of the Kostanay region in a well-to-do family. Having lost his father early, he was brought up by his grandfather, Biy Balgozha Dzhan-burchin, who served in the Orenburg border commission and enjoyed great influence among the ruling elite, and especially among the Kazakhs of the Orenburg steppes. At the same time, Balgozha was a connoisseur of Kazakh oral literary creativity, sometimes he himself composed poetry, was an eloquent orator.
In 1850, when one of the first schools for Kazakh children was opened in Orenburg, the administrative center of the Turgai region, the purpose of which was to prepare literate people for the tsarist administration, my grandfather identified Ibrai as a student. About the period of his studies at school, one of the archival documents has been preserved, which says that he was distinguished by perseverance and independence.<br><br>
In 1857, Ibrai Altynsarin successfully graduated from school and was left at the Orenburg border commission, where he worked as a clerk for about three years. Here he continued to improve the level of his knowledge, carefully read and studied his native history, literature, scientific works and works of art of Eastern, Russian and Western European culture.
<br><br>
I. Altynsarin, seized with a high desire to bring as much benefit to his native people, dreamed of doing pedagogical work, in which he saw his calling. After long troubles and difficulties, he managed to leave Orenburg in 1860 and transfer to the city of Turgai, but even here the local tsarist authorities for a long time did not give Ibrai Altynsarin the opportunity to devote himself to his beloved teaching profession, defining him as an assistant judge, then as a judge, assistant chief, and ... about. head of the county. Only in 1865 was it finally possible to switch to pedagogical work. Later, for almost 20 years, he held leading positions in the system of public education.
As an inspector for public education in the Turgai district, he proved himself to be an outstanding organizer, a talented teacher, a well-known writer-educator and a prominent public figure. "Schools are the main springs of the education of the Kyrgyz, Kazakhs," wrote Ibrai Altynsarin, "... on them, and especially on them, hope, in them is the future of the Kyrgyz (Kazakh) people." A champion of enlightenment, I. Altynsarin considered it the sacred duty of an educated person to bring knowledge to children.<br><br>
His desire to teach Kazakh children in such a way that they could be useful to their people and join the achievements of agriculture, industry met with resistance from two sides. The tsarist administration was interested in training the lower echelon of officials from the local population, capable of conducting office work in Russian, being clerks, translators, brought up in the spirit of adaptation to the colonial policy of tsarism. <br><br>Therefore, she outwardly did not oppose Altynsarin's initiative to teach Kazakh children the Russian language, but did not provide any support to the idea of a broad education. On the other hand, the local clergy opposed Ibrai's innovations, trying to instill that he allegedly wanted to "baptize" Kazakh children and prepare them for "soldier's service" in the Russian army. Altynsarin really opposed ignorance, superstition, confinement within the framework of an outdated nomadic life and those clergymen who used Islam for selfish purposes and even in the interests of the imperial ideology, according to which, "following Mohammed, be servants of the white king."
